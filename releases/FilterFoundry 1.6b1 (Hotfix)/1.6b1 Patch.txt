
FilterFoundry 1.6b1 for Windows Hotfix
======================================

The two most severe bugs in 1.6b1 can be hotfixed by editing the binary file.
All bugs have been solved in 1.7+

(1) Patching memory bug 1.6b1

Problem: FilterFoundry crashes at start if the computer
has too much RAM (maxSpace variable calculation).
Emergency patch: Disable "DoPrepare" function

8BF Search:    B8 67 66 66 66
8BF Replace:   89 46 2C 66 66

Fixed in SVN Rev 106, main.c, method DoPrepare (published in 1.7.0.1)


(2) Obfuscate loading bug

Problem: Obfuscated filters can be built, but not be loaded.
The problem cannot be easily solved, therefore it is
the best to prevent the option.
Therefore, remove the obfuscate checkbox using a resource editor.

Fixed in SVN Rev 106, load_win.c, method readPARMresource (published in 1.7.0.1)

Reason: Tried to edit LockResource memory. But LockResource memory
is read-only. Therefore, you need a copy. This is impossible
to be done using a hex-patch. Need a recompile!
