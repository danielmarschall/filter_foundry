
Windows NT 3.1 compatibility problems
-------------------------------------

Fixed problems:
---------------

- `GetEnvironmentStringsA` and `FreeEnvironmentStrings` not found in WinAPI.

	Fixed: The CLib of OpenWatcom 1.9 imports these two functions.
	OpenWatcom 2.0 (beta nov 1 2017) calls these functions dynamically and is therefore compatible with Windows NT 3.1.

- `CreateDIBSection` not found in WinAPI

	Fixed in SVN Revision 407 (removed because not required).

- `GetVersionEx` not found in WinAPI.

	Fixed in SVN Revision 411 (calling dynamically now).

- `RegisterClassExA` and `GetClassInfoExA` not found in WinAPI.

	Fixed in SVN Revision 412 (replaced by `RegisterClassA` and `GetClassInfoA`).

Open problems:
--------------

- BIG PROBLEM: "msctls_trackbar32" is not supported. DialogBoxParamA crashes with the confusing error code "Invalid Cursor Handle".
	Note: msctls_trackbar32 seems to be defined in COMCTL32.DLL, but Win NT 3.1 has no REGSVR32.EXE, so there can't be any controls added??
	For now, we added an error message if the class can't be found.

- `LoadImageA` not found in WinAPI ... how should we draw it? Filter Factory uses DrawIcon on a STATIC contral Ownerdraw.
	Remove "Hand Question" cursor in order to use the "Static" class instead of the custom class "CautionIcon"?

- If hand cursor is not existing in Windows, then use a handpointer located in the resources.

- Icons (+, - and exclamation sign) are drawn too big and graphics are broken (probably need low color?)

- Help button does not work

- Preview image is not drawn at dialog box opening. You need to enter something first.

- Create 64 bit plugin: Error "Not a valid NT image" at `UpdateVersionInfoWithHandle` (probably doesn't support "Load as Datafile")

- Versioninfo is not adjusted, even for Win 32 standalone plugins

Questions:
----------

Which CPU architecture is required for OpenWatcom settings? Should we do very low settings 80386?
