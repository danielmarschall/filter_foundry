FilterFoundry
Copyright (C) 2003-4 Toby Thain <toby@telegraphics.com.au>

This is a Photoshop filter plugin compatible with Adobe's Filter Factory.

For more information, see:
http://thepluginsite.com/knowhow/ffpg/ffpg.htm

Please note the following limitations of version 1.0.
  
* Trig functions use the Mac Filter Factory definition,
  a range of -1024..+1024 (rather than Windows FF's -512..+512).
  This is likely to be a user preference in future.

* The 68K Macintosh build requires 68020 or later CPU and FPU.

Contact support@telegraphics.com.au with any questions, comments, bug fixes etc.
