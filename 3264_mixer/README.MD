# Filter Foundry 32/64 bit mixer

This is an internal tool used in the post-build process of Filter Foundry 1.7.

Besides a some cosmetics, its main purpose is to add the 32-bit DLL to the 64-bit 8BF (as resource) and vice-versa. This is required so that Filter Foundry can create 32 and 64 bit standalone filters at the same time.
