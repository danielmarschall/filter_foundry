===========================================================

Important/Bugs
--------------

* In ui_mac.c, there does not seem to be a limit for the expressions. So, is it possible
  to write an expression longer than 1023 bytes, which would lead to a crash?

* Test with 64 Bit Mac, and publish 1.7 (when can we leave the beta state?)
  Windows 64 is already tested. We just need an updated Makefile.
  
* For Mac, please look at the (*) marked entries in version.h and verify the bugs/fixes
  and/or apply the changes on Mac.


Minor priority stuff or ideas
-----------------------------

* Create and evaluate more testcases, and either fix differences between FilterFactory and
  FilterFoundry, or document them in "Filter Factory Compatibility.txt"

* Should an expression like "----r" be forbidden? (Multiple negate signs) On the other hand, FilterFactory
  didn't forbit them either.
  
* CMYK mode is possible (although a bit misleading to have r=c, g=m, b=y, a=k), but then it is impossible to
  control the alpha channel.

* Other Telegraphics Filters have the same problem in VERSIONINFO where the translation
  strings "04900000" don't fit together "080904B0" (fixed in Filter Foundry)

* I have found following in the source code: Do we need to do something here?
	strcpy(gdata->parm.formula[i],expr[i] ? expr[i] : "bug! see builddlgitem");

* Add pow() or "**" operator?

* Create a Visual Studio project file

* Search for TODO and FIXME in the code

* Evaluate the file "Filter Factory Compatibility.txt" and think about if we should
  change some of our functions to become 100% compatible with Filter Factory.
  
* There is no warning if a formula contains a number that exceeds 32 bits.

* Check, if all combinations of imports work:

* Minor bug: Testcase rst_3.afs applied to a 1000x1000 canvas:
  When the preview is zoomed in to 29% or 59%, and the preview is panned, the
  bars change during panning. It does not look "smooth" like in 100%, 50%, or 25% zoom.
  The problem is that the offset of the preview area is always different, and if the zoom
  level is not a multiple of two, you will always "pick" other bars.
  
* In regards "Apple scripting" (AETE resource):

	a) Why do we include the AETE resource in Windows, and use fixaete() in the build-process,
	   although there is no AppleScript support on Windows?
	   
	b) In a standalone filter, should the AETE dictionary only contain the controls which are used
	   by the built filter, and should these dictionary entries have the correct user-defined
	   control/slider name?

* Fast (double) click in [+]/[-] scroll buttons is not accepted as 2 clicks / zoom-requests

* Should we make FilterFoundry compatible with very old Windows OS?
  In re WinXP compatibility:
	Works!
  In re Win2000 compatibility:
	Unresolved Kernel32.dll symbols (reason: used Windows SDK is "too new"):
	- DecodePointer
	- GetModuleHandleExW
	- InitializeSListHead
	- InterlockedFlushSList
  In re Win98 compatibility:
	Unresolved Kernel32.dll symbols (reason: used Windows SDK is "too new"):
	- DecodePointer
	- GetModuleHandleExW
	- InitializeSListHead
	- InterlockedFlushSList
	- GetFileSizeEx
	- SetFilePointerEx
	Note: FilterFoundry 1.6b1 didn't work in Win98 either, although there
	      were no unresolved symbols; so there seem to be other problems as well.
	
* Support more colors modes and 16bit. Why is Lab color not accepted, although doesSupportLABColor is set?
	
* Add Unicode support? (Does PiPL support Unicode at all?)

* Build filter: Individualize Manifest resource (Attention: htmlentities)

* Picture with 78x63 in grayscale mode: In preview on the left side there is a black bar


Design/UI Tweaks
----------------

* The exclamation mark symbols should have a tooltip ("hint") when the mouse hovers over it. (Also for Mac)
  Not sure how easy it is to do that with WIN32 API

* Should it be possible to zoom more than 100%?

* The vertical scrollbar should auto-hide when the expression formula is short. (Also for Mac)
  Unfortunately, this task is very hard in WIN32 API.

* Should there be more space for expressions, like in Filter Factory?

* Standalone filter: Map labels should be centered between two sliders, like in Filter Factory

* Sliders are extremely tiny!

* simplealert() is only "appmodal" and has no hWnd. Due to this, the window is not blinking when
  the user tries to click on a parent window. (Is this a Windows bug?)
