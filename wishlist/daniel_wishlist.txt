===========================================================

Important/Bugs
--------------

* BUG: alertuser() and simplealert() are not modal. They need a parent window handle.
	(Does this bug also happen on Mac?)

* In ui_mac.c, there does not seem to be a limit for the expressions. So, is it possible
  to write an expression longer than 1023 bytes, which would lead to a crash?

* Test with 64 Bit Mac, and publish 1.7 (when can we leave the beta state?)


Minor priority stuff or ideas
-----------------------------

* The VERSIONINFO resource is added in PiPl.rc - but that would mean it will also be included in Mac binaries?
  I think it should be added to a new file version_win.rc , which is included only by win_res.rc
  
* Should an expression like "----r" be forbidden? (Multiple negate signs) On the other hand, FilterFactory
  didn't forbit them either.
  
* CMYK mode is possible (although a bit misleading to have r=c, g=m, b=y, a=k), but then it is impossible to
  control the alpha channel.

* Other Telegraphics Filters have the same problem in VERSIONINFO where the translation
  strings "04900000" don't fit together "080904B0" (fixed in Filter Foundry)

* The following formula acts a bit weird in comparison to Filter Factory:
	r = rnd(0,x)+rst(3)	
	g = rnd(0,y)	
	b = rnd(0,y-x)

* I have found following in the source code: Do we need to do something here?
	strcpy(gdata->parm.formula[i],expr[i] ? expr[i] : "bug! see builddlgitem");

* Add pow() or "**" operator?

* Create a Visual Studio project file

* Search for TODO and FIXME in the code


Design/UI Tweaks
----------------

* The exlamation mark symbols should have a tooltip ("hint") when the mouse hovers over it. (Also for Mac)
  Not sure how easy it is to do that with WIN32 API

* Should it be possible to zoom more than 100%?

* The vertical scrollbar should auto-hide when the expression formula is short. (Also for Mac)
  Unfortunately, this task is very hard in WIN32 API.

* Should there be more space for expressions, like in Filter Factory?

* Standalone filter: Map labels should be centered between two sliders, like in Filter Factory
