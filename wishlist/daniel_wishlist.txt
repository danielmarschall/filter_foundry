===========================================================

Important/Bugs
--------------

* In ui_mac.c, there does not seem to be a limit for the expressions. So, is it possible
  to write an expression longer than 1023 bytes, which would lead to a crash?

* Test with 64 Bit Mac, and publish 1.7 (when can we leave the beta state?)
  Windows 64 is already tested. We just need an updated Makefile.

* Create and evaluate more testcases, and either fix differences between FilterFactory and
  FilterFoundry, or document them in "Filter Factory Compatibility.txt"
  
  
Minor priority bugs
-------------------

* When you have a formula with rnd(), panning in the preview image will not show
  any differences in the preview's random pixel data. If the picture only contains random pixels,
  then it looks like the panning doesn't work at all.
  Example:
  	R=rnd(0,128)
  	G=x*255/X    (<-- to demonstrate that the panning actually works)
  	B=0
  	A=255
  Reason:
  When functions which modify the internal state (i.e. rst, rnd and put) are called with conditions (e.g. x==0?rst(y):0 ),
  and the zoomed in preview area does not meet these conditions (e.g. preview stats at x=100), then
  the state-changing function(s) will not be called, and therefore the preview would be wrong.
  If these state-changing functions are existing in the code, the whole canvas must be calculated, even if
  the zoomed in preview will only show a part of it.


Minor priority stuff or ideas
-----------------------------

* Create more test cases and compare various functions between Filter Foundry and Filter Factory.

* The VERSIONINFO resource is added in PiPl.rc - but that would mean it will also be included in Mac binaries?
  I think it should be added to a new file version_win.rc , which is included only by win_res.rc
  
* Should an expression like "----r" be forbidden? (Multiple negate signs) On the other hand, FilterFactory
  didn't forbit them either.
  
* CMYK mode is possible (although a bit misleading to have r=c, g=m, b=y, a=k), but then it is impossible to
  control the alpha channel.

* Other Telegraphics Filters have the same problem in VERSIONINFO where the translation
  strings "04900000" don't fit together "080904B0" (fixed in Filter Foundry)

* I have found following in the source code: Do we need to do something here?
	strcpy(gdata->parm.formula[i],expr[i] ? expr[i] : "bug! see builddlgitem");

* Add pow() or "**" operator?

* Create a Visual Studio project file

* Search for TODO and FIXME in the code

* Evaluate the file "Filter Factory Compatibility.txt" and think about if we should
  change some of our functions to become 100% compatible with Filter Factory.
  
* There is no warning if a formula contains a number that exceeds 32 bits.


Design/UI Tweaks
----------------

* The exclamation mark symbol is looking pixelated, since it is resized from 16x16 to 12x12.

* The exclamation mark symbols should have a tooltip ("hint") when the mouse hovers over it. (Also for Mac)
  Not sure how easy it is to do that with WIN32 API

* Should it be possible to zoom more than 100%?

* The vertical scrollbar should auto-hide when the expression formula is short. (Also for Mac)
  Unfortunately, this task is very hard in WIN32 API.

* Should there be more space for expressions, like in Filter Factory?

* Standalone filter: Map labels should be centered between two sliders, like in Filter Factory
