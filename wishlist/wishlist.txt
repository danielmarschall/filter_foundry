SYNOPSIS:

	Filter Foundry development wishlist.


DESCRIPTION:

	  Compile a list of development needs to establish a finalized
	version of Filter Foundry, and to improve or expand on its
	current capabilities as a viable option to plugin development
	without the requirement of complicated programming languages.


CURRENT VERSION TESTING:

	1.4 beta 5 (1.4b5)



IMPROVEMENTS/BUGS:

	* Convolutions 'cnv()' function was radically improved allowing
	  for entire image processing without a one pixel border limitation
	  in previous versions. (Resolved from previous communication.)

	* -1 pixel offset compensation when tiling appears to be eliminated,
	  as was typical with Filter Factory and code requirements. This is
	  a value-added development, but mysterious in how it effects the
	  other processing functions. (Evaluate code and test?)



PRIORITY NEEDS:

	* Establish processing fixes/bugs where needed. One example is
	  imcompatibility with former Filter Factory scripts not working
	  properly [ie: Simple Tile tools, repeating edge problem].

	  (If a documentation issue based on processing changes, then
	  documentation required for the updated code structure.)

	* Control captions currently not being applied in compiled plugins.

	* Obfuscation or hiding of PARM source in compiled binary .8bf.

	  (Prefered as a checkbox option in the Make dialogue, or include
	  with the 'Protect' option already established.)

	* Make additional captions optional (Copyright, Author, etc.)
	  (Don't place box in dialogue at all if nothing entered.)

	* Fix compiled plugin dialogue to read the filter's name.
	  [ie: CAPTION "Filters Name Goes Here"]
	  Currently defaults to "Filter Foundry"

	* Determine if all default CONTROLs can read STATIC and not "Static"?
	  (Noticed in ResHacker when editing a dialogue - ResHacker automatically
	  Compiles Script to read STATIC, and extracts the additional 001fxx types.)

	* Add a checkbox option to Preview image adjustment in real-time, and
	  possibly allow being able to scroll through the main image window.
	  [Like native Photoshop plugins.]



DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS (Future Development / Expansion):

	* Support all Photoshop color spaces, RGB, Grayscale, CMYK, and LaB.

	* Multi-channel support (Being able to process all channels, regardless
	  of color-space). [ie: If additional channels are loaded, then 4 channels
	  will have their own space for code. - Red, Green, Blue, Alpha1, etc, A]

	* Add options for Levels display (to be able to see what any adjustment
	  does to the histogram in real-time).

	* Consider a dialogue editor while building plugins, instead of automatic
	  captions / labeling - a la ResHacker dialogue editor.

	  (This would fully surpass the traditional Filter Factory dialogue and
	  produce something more flexible and unique, but with the same or
	  current coding environment established in Filter Foundry.)

	* Consider expanding on code, to include support for alpha blending to
	  blend pixels together. [ie: If making a seamless tile, then code in
	  the blend amount between pixels that overlap]

	  (This would take Filter Foundry to the next level beyond what Filter
	  Factory had established, by allowing an additional range of options
	  to explore in filter creation.) - If this is possible.

	  'alph()' function? Similar to the scl() or mix() functions?

  with Filter Factory compatibilities.)
