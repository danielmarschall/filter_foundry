
Severe incompatibilities with GIMP / PSPI
-----------------------------------------

1. Filter cannot be loaded by PSPI, because of a memory error.

	Status: FIXED (Bug in FF) in FilterFoundry 1.7
	
	FilterFoundry 1.6 used wrong length values for the TLV (Type, Length, Value) members
	of the PIPL structury (in RC files, and in fixpipl()).
	The length value must include everything, including paddings of strings.
	Adobe writes in SPPiPL.h "Number of characters in the data array. Rounded to a multiple of 4."
	
2. Filters will only fill the bottom of the picture, not the whole canvas.

	Status: FIXED (Workaround) in FilterFoundry 1.7
	
	The reason is that OnContinue/main.c:RequestNext() processes the image in chunks,
	and probably due to a bug, PSPI only applies the image data of the last chunk.

	Workaround applied in FF 1.7: If the host signature is 'GIMP', then we set
	needall=1 to disable chunked processing.

3. When you re-open the main window, the formulas of the previous session vanish.

	Status: FIXED (Workaround) in FilterFoundry 1.7

	The reason is a bug in PSPI: The host should preserve the value of pb->parameters, which PSPI does not do.
	Also, all global variables are unloaded, so the plugin cannot preserve any data.	   

	Workaround in FF 1.7: If the host GIMP is detected, the new flag persistent_savestate will be set.
	This mode saves the filter data into a temporary file "tmp.afs" and loads it
	when the window is opened again.

4. Saving does not work

	Status: FIXED (Workaround) in FilterFoundry 1.7

	Filters could not be saved as AFS files because PSPI can't handle zero-sized handles
	(PINEWHANDLE), so FF 1.7 is now assigning 1 byte for these.
