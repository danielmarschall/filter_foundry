
Please download "Adobe Photoshop SDK" here:
https://www.adobe.com/devnet/photoshop/sdk.html (*)

Then extract its contents in this directory:
- connectionsdk/
- images/
- pluginsdk/
- license.html
- ReadMe.html



Note: The download of SDK 2017 at the end of the EULA page
won't work on some browsers due to security settings:
"adobe.com" uses HTTPS, while the download target "macromedia.com" uses HTTP.
Therefore, the download does not work.
Direct download of SDK 2017 here:
http://download.macromedia.com/pub/developer/photoshop/sdk/adobe_photoshop_sdk_cc_2017_win.zip
