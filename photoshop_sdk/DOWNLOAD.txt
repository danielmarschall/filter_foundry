
How to download the latest version of the SDK:

1. Go to https://www.adobe.com/devnet/photoshop/sdk.html

2. At the section "C++ SDK", click "Download the SDK"

3. You need to create a Adobe developer account now,
   or log in if you already have an account.

4. Scroll down to "Photoshop" (NOT "Adobe Photoshop API (Trial)")
   and then click "View downloads".

5. Download "Photoshop Plug-In and Connection SDK" for Windows.

6. Once you have obtained the SDK, extract the SDK contents in the "photoshop_sdk" directory:
   - connectionsdk/
   - images/
   - pluginsdk/
   - license.html
   - ReadMe.html

   These folders are excluded in SVN and GIT to avoid that they
   are accidentally uploaded somewhere.

   Note: Actually, you only need the following files:
   - pluginsdk/photoshopapi/photoshop/*.h
   - pluginsdk/photoshopapi/pica_sp/*.h
   - pluginsdk/photoshopapi/resources/*.r


Important:
Please carefully read the SDK EULA before processing!
The SDK contents are NOT part of this plugin source code,
and they are not subject to the plugin's license!
The SDK contents may not be distributed together with the plugin
or the plugin source code, and must stay on the computer of the developer.

If you do not agree to the EULA of the latest SDK,
you could try to obtain an older version of the SDK which
might have different license terms. For example, the SDK was
also distributed with Photoshop 6.0 and earlier.


Compatibility:
The source code has been built with SDK 6.0, CS2, CS3 beta, CC 2017, and 2022
but older versions should work, too.
(If building with SDK v4, edit 68k.r, carbon.r, classic.r, and PiMI_68k.r
to remove references to "PIResDefines.h", "PiPL.r" and "PiMI.r" and replace
with a single #include "PIGeneral.r"; also remove "fmtCanWriteTransparency"
from PiPL_common.r.)


Additional notes:
- Adobe's stand in regards to using SDK to write OpenSource plugins:
  https://web.archive.org/web/20070203075622/http://blogs.adobe.com/notesfrommnr/2006/04/using_adobe_sdk.html
  So it should be fine if the SDK contents are not included in the plugin's source code and not part of the license.
- The GPL license has some problems with this:
  https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#FSWithNFLibs
- Unfortunately, the fork of ViaThinkSoft is bound to the license that has been set in the original project of Toby Thain.
