
Please download the Adobe Photoshop SDK here:
https://www.adobe.com/devnet/photoshop/sdk.html
	Note: The download of SDK 2017 at the end of the EULA page
	won't work on some browsers due to security settings:
	"adobe.com" uses HTTPS, while the download target "macromedia.com" uses HTTP.
	Therefore, the download does not work.
	Direct download of SDK 2017 here:
	http://download.macromedia.com/pub/developer/photoshop/sdk/adobe_photoshop_sdk_cc_2017_win.zip



Important:
Please carefully read the SDK EULA before processing!
The SDK contents are NOT part of this plugin source code,
and they are not subject to the plugin's license!
The SDK contents may not be distributed together with the plugin
or the plugin source code, and must stay on the computer of the developer.

If you do not agree to the EULA of the latest SDK,
you could try to obtain an older version of the SDK which
might have different license terms. This plugin should be
compatible with older versions of the SDK too.


Once you have obtained the SDK, extract the SDK contents in this directory:
- connectionsdk/
- images/
- pluginsdk/
- license.html
- ReadMe.html

These folders are excluded in SVN and GIT to avoid that they
are accidentally uploaded somewhere.


Actually, you only need the following files:
- pluginsdk/photoshopapi/photoshop/*.h
- pluginsdk/photoshopapi/pica_sp/*.h


Additional notes:
- Adobe's stand in regards to using SDK to write OpenSource plugins:
  https://web.archive.org/web/20070203075622/http://blogs.adobe.com/notesfrommnr/2006/04/using_adobe_sdk.html
  So it should be fine if the SDK contents are not included in the plugin's source code and not part of the license.
- The GPL license has some problems with this:
  https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#FSWithNFLibs
- Unfortunately, the fork of ViaThinkSoft is bound to the license that has been set in the original project of Toby Thain.
